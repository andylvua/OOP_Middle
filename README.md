## Task

Develop the solution that will allow you to extract information about a company from its domain. Your application
should support the following information:

* Company name
* Twitter URL
* Facebook URL
* Company logo
* Company icon
* Number of employees
* Company address

## Solution

We have developed a simple web scraping API based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/)

### Diagrams and used patterns

Diagram of the project structure, use case diagram, and description of the used patterns are available in the [tasks](tasks) folder.

## Usage

### General usage

The API is available at [middle-scraping-api.herokuapp.com](https://middle-scraping-api.herokuapp.com).

To get information about a company, send a GET request to the `scraping.api/scrape` endpoint with the `domain` parameter:

```bash
curl https://middle-scraping-api.herokuapp.com/scraping.api/scrape?domain={{domain}}
```

or, if you prefer to use a UI, go to [middle-scraping-api.herokuapp.com](https://middle-scraping-api.herokuapp.com/).

Here, you can enter the domain name and click the submit button to get the information about the company.

### Build locally

```bash
mvn package
